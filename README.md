### Greetings! Welcome! Glad to see you!

I'm glad you came to see what I did here :)

Here are small steps on how to run a project on your PC.

###First way
1. Go to `package.json` in `grapql` folder
2. Run the `installDeps` script  or write in terminal `npm run installDeps` to install client and server dependencies.
3. Run the dev command in the `package.json` file or write to terminal `npm run dev`
4. Excellent! Now you can follow the link <http://localhost:3000/>
